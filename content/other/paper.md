# 导出一篇论文的所有引用
So far I have researched the following workflow:

1) extract a list of all references from a PDF article using [CERMINE](http://cermine.ceon.pl/index.html);

2) parse the list using WizFolio (credit to Kumar Vignesh from EndNote technical support team) and export found references to a RIS file;

3) import the RIS file to EndNote (see http://www.screencast.com/t/NjFkMDc1N).

 

The way is still long and not straightforward...
